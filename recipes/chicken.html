    <h2 class ="head">Description</h2>
    <p class ="para">This baked sweet and sour chicken made with chicken thighs and pineapple is a "dump" version of one of the most
        popular dishes in a Chinese restaurant. Skip the deep frying and bake everything together in one dish to create
        a lighter twist on a classic with no sacrifice of flavor.</p>
    <h2 class="head">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class ="para">
        <li>3/4 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/3 cup bite-sized onion chunks</li>
        <li>1/3 green bell pepper, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
        <li>1/3 red bell pepper, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
        <li>1/3 cup bite-sized pineapple chunks</li>
        <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger paste (such as Gourmet Gardenâ„¢)</li>
        <li>1 green onion, sliced, or as needed (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="head">Steps</h2>
    <ol class ="para">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish or spray with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li">Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, cut into 1-inch chunks, and add to the dish. Sprinkle with
            cornstarch, and toss until chicken is coated. Stir in onions, green and red bell peppers, and pineapple.
        </li>
        <li>Add ketchup, rice vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger paste to a small bowl, whisk until
            well combined, and stir into the chicken mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Bake until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 14 to 17 minutes, stirring halfway
            through. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). If
            sauce is a bit thick, stir in a splash of water to thin out until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Garnish with green onion slices and serve.</li>
